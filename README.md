# Converting images into spreadsheets
This program uses openpyxl, numpy and opencv to convert an image into cells in a spreadsheet.

### How?
- Each row of pixels in the image is represented in the spreadsheet by a blue green and red row
- Each cell in the spreadsheet then gets a value based on its color
- Each row is formatted so that the value of the cells defines the color of the cells
